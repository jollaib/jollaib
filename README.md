## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jose Luis LlÃ¡cer and I am a **FULL STACK DEVELOPER**. I have studied Telecommunications Engeneering and Bussiness Administration. Later I joined the `4Geeks Bootcamp` where I developed as a final project an airline software called JETStream, 
I am currently developing a football results App with `Flutter` using Firebase as backend. 
I am keen to solve problems and keep developing.
